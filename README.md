This repository contains hits from DrugBank selected by QSAR models developed in python using publicly available data for SARS-CoV 3C-like protease.

* Molecular docking based on the 2020 crystal structure of COVID19 3C-like protease, which has 96% similarity with SARS-CoV 3C-like protease and a concerved active site.
* Similarity search based on the three active compounds described [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0282-0) by Want et al.
